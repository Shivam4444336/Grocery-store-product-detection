## Grocery store product detection:
- This repository contains scripts for grocery store product detection. 
## Dataset preparation:
- [Grocery Dataset](https://github.com/gulvarol/grocerydataset) had products from 10 categories/brand indexed from 1-10 and one no product category indexed as 0.To leverage no product vs product detection classes 1-10 were assigned an index of 1 with label 'Product' and the other category with 0 index was labelled as 'No Product'.Steps for detailed dataset preparation has been mentioned in [Data_Preparation.ipynb file](https://github.com/Shivam4444336/Grocery-store-product-detection/blob/main/Data_Preparation.ipynb).
